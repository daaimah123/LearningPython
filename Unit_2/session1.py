~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 1 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a function is_subsequence() that takes in a list of integers 'lst' and a list of integers 'sequence' as parameters. Given these two lists, determine whether the 'sequence' list is a subsequence of the 'lst' list. A subsequence of a list is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent but are in the same relative order as they appear in the list. Return True if sequence is a subsequence, and False otherwise.

Example Usage:
lst = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

keys[i] should be paired with values[i] in the dictionary where 0 <= i <= len(keys). You may assume keys and values are the same length.

Example Input:

Write a function restock_inventory() that updates an inventory dictionary based on a restock list. It accepts two parameters:

'current_inventory': a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an item and its current stock in the inventory
'restock_list': a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an item and the quantity to be added to the inventory
If an item in restock_list is not present in the current_inventory, it should be added. The function should return the updated dictionary current_inventory.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 6 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a function calculate_gpa() that calculates the grade point average (GPA) for a student based on their course grades and returns the gpa as a float. The function takes in a dictionary report_card as a parameter where each key-value pair represents a course and the grade received in that course respectively. The grades are represented as strings ("A", "B", "C", "D", "F") and each grade corresponds to a certain number of grade points:

"A" = 4
