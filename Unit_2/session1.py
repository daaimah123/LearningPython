~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 1 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a function is_subsequence() that takes in a list of integers lst and a list of integers sequence as parameters. Given these two lists, determine whether the sequence list is a subsequence of the lst list. A subsequence of a list is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent but are in the same relative order as they appear in the list. Return True if sequence is a subsequence, and False otherwise.

def is_subsequence(lst, sequence):
    pass

Example Usage:
lst = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
print(is_subsequence(lst, sequence))
Example Output: True

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a function create_dictionary() that takes in a list of keys and a list of values as parameters. The function returns a dictionary where each item in keys is paired with a corresponding item in values.

keys[i] should be paired with values[i] in the dictionary where 0 <= i <= len(keys). You may assume keys and values are the same length.

def create_dictionary(keys, values):
    pass

Example Input:
keys = ["peanut", "dragon", "star", "pop", "space"]

Write a function print_pair() that takes in a dictionary dictionary and a key target as parameters. The function looks for the target and when found, it prints the key and it's associated value as "Key: <key>" followed by "Value: <value>". If target is not in dictionary, print "That pair does not exist!".

def print_pair(dictionary, target):

Example Usage:
dictionary = {"spongebob": "squarepants", "patrick": "star", "squidward": "tentacles"}
print_pair(dictionary, "patrick")
print_pair(dictionary, "plankton")
print_pair(dictionary, "spongebob")

Example Output:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 4 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a function keys_v_values() that takes in a dictionary dictionary whose keys and values are both integers. The function should find the sum of all keys in the dictionary and the sum of all values.
If the sum of all keys is greater than the sum of all values, the function should return the string "keys".
If the sum of all values is greater than the sum of all keys, the function should return the string "values".
If keys and values have equal sums, the function should return the string "balanced".

def keys_v_values(dictionary):

Example Usage:

dictionary1 = {1:10, 2:20, 3:30, 4:40, 5:50, 6:60}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 5 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a function restock_inventory() that updates an inventory dictionary based on a restock list. It accepts two parameters:

current_inventory: a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an item and its current stock in the inventory
restock_list: a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an item and the quantity to be added to the inventory
If an item in restock_list is not present in the current_inventory, it should be added. The function should return the updated dictionary current_inventory.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 6 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a function calculate_gpa() that calculates the grade point average (GPA) for a student based on their course grades and returns the gpa as a float. The function takes in a dictionary report_card as a parameter where each key-value pair represents a course and the grade received in that course respectively. The grades are represented as strings ("A", "B", "C", "D", "F") and each grade corresponds to a certain number of grade points:
